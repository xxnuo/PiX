A PiX session is not a line — it is a graph that keeps growing: every conversation turn is a node, and any node can sprout a new branch at any time.

## Non-linear sessions

A traditional AI chat is a single timeline: to change direction you either start over or keep piling questions onto the same thread until the context becomes a mess.

PiX organizes a session as a graph that grows left to right:

- Every turn (your prompt plus the assistant's reply and tool calls) is a node on the graph.
- Several directions can live on the same graph — switch to another branch at any time and keep going, without interference.
- When a path works out, keep going deeper; dead ends stay on the graph, and you can always come back and try another route.
- Sessions are real Pi sessions — no new format — so they remain usable outside PiX.

## Branch anytime

Branching is an everyday action in PiX, not something you have to plan ahead:

- **Fork from any user message**: unhappy with an answer? Fork a new branch from that turn with a different prompt or approach — the original branch stays untouched.
- **Continue from a turn**: select any earlier node on the graph and pick up the conversation from that moment.
- **Clone the active branch**: clone the current branch as a save point and experiment freely. Every branch stays visible on the graph, ready to switch back to at any time.

## Context follows the branch

Switching branches never means re-setting up context — context is part of the branch:

- The **branch chat panel** shows only the messages of the active branch. Switch to another branch and the chat switches with it.
- A single click highlights a node on the graph without touching any panel (graph commands such as /fork act on the highlighted node); a double-click aligns the primary chat panel to that node.
- Double-click a node on the graph to open its conversation in the primary chat panel. Ctrl+double-click (or the right-click menu's "Open in chat panel") pins that branch to a second or third side-by-side chat column — up to 3 columns at once for comparing branches. Each branch keeps a single panel: opening another node of an already-pinned branch retargets that column. Every column scrolls and replies independently. Replying from a pinned column grows that branch in place: the column follows the newly created node, and the primary column keeps the current selection. Closing the last pinned column — or the next start — restores the chat width.
- The **branch context panel** follows the selected node and shows how that turn went: thinking, tool calls, duration, and step count — and you can reply to the selected node right from there.

## Built-in extensions

PiX embeds Pi 1.0, including its MCP, Codemode and tool-search extensions. Existing Pi v3 JSONL sessions keep working. Tool images and nested call records appear in the branch chat; Pi saves nested call names, arguments and status, but not every nested output.

Settings → Model groups available models into Chat, Image generation and Classifiers, with counts and type filters. Image and classifier models are used through Codemode; only chat models appear in conversation pickers or support default, cycling and thinking preferences.

Configure MCP in `~/.pix/agent/mcp.json` or a trusted project's `.pi/mcp.json`, on the machine running the session. After editing these files, run `/reload`, then `/mcp` for status, `/mcp login [server]` to sign in, or `/mcp reconnect [server]` to reconnect. PiX supports extension selection, input and confirmation dialogs; TUI-specific custom components still need the Pi terminal.

Connecting an MCP server with the default `codemode` exposure activates Codemode automatically. To enable it yourself, append `, +codemode` to the existing list in Settings → Tools & images → Default tools, then click outside the field to save. This is a project setting: new sessions inherit it, and PiX automatically reloads the current session when it is idle. No manual `/reload` is needed for this settings-page change.

The Codemode tool access setting controls how an active Codemode tool presents other tools; it does not enable Codemode. `on` (Alongside other tools) keeps direct tool calls available; `only` (Only through Codemode) hides those direct calls from the model. See [Pi's MCP configuration](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/v1.0.0/packages/coding-agent/docs/mcp.md) for server configuration.

PiX also bundles two extensions with native binaries. They and their runtime dependencies ship with the installer — no separate install needed, and an npm copy you installed through Pi takes precedence.

- **`@ff-labs/pi-fff` — fast file and content search**: replaces the built-in `find` / `grep` tools with FFF (Rust-native, SIMD-accelerated): `fffind` fuzzy file-name search, `ffgrep` content search, and `fff-multi-grep` multi-pattern search. Files are pre-indexed in the background at session start so searches return instantly; results are frecency-ranked (frequently used files first) and boosted for git-modified and untracked files.
- **`@injaneity/pi-computer-use` — desktop app control**: lets the agent observe and operate desktop apps on macOS, Windows, and Linux: find open apps and windows, read the text and controls on screen, click, type, scroll, and wait for the UI to change. Useful when an app has no API and the on-screen interface is all there is (the macOS helper requires macOS 14 or newer).

`pi-web-access` does not ship with the installer: install it with one click on the Settings → Extensions page and keep it current with `pi update`. It gives the agent web search, URL fetching, PDF extraction, and GitHub research; web search services still use your own configuration and credentials.

PiX also loads internal extensions: `file-changes` snapshots files before and after the agent edits or writes them to power the "Changes" panel; `git-branch` records the working Git branch for each user turn.

## Run

Requires Node.js 22.19 or newer. PiX is a local web UI: Node hosts the backend, and the frontend opens in your browser.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The browser opens `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`. For a production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

`npm run verify` runs the full typecheck and test suite. `npm run test:fff` checks bundled file search and Codemode; `npm run test:web` checks the web extension's installed layout (a real npm install, needs network) and page fetching.
